Today, Nuage Networks announces a plugin for vRealize Orchestrator. This plugin is the next step in the integration with VMware environments and exposes the full VSPK capabilities to vRealize Orchestrator.

By providing a plugin for vRealize Ochestrator, Nuage Networks also provides a better integration for solutions like vCloud Director and vRealize Automation.

![vRO Integration overview][vro-integration]

The plugin comes with a set of vRealize Orchestrator workflows to interact with objects inside the Nuage Networks VSP. It allows for the creation of more complex workflows, actions and scripts to manage all the capabilities and features of your Nuage VSP environments.

This plugin is currently in a beta stage and it is possible for customers to get early access by contacting your Nuage contact for more information.

We will also be providing more documentation and an in-depth article on this plugin in the future, covering in more details the install, configuration and the capabilities of the plugin.
