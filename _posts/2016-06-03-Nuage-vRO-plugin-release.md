Today, Nuage Networks is announcing its plugin for vRealize Orchestrator. This plugin is a next step in the integration with VMware environments and exposes the full VSPK capabilities to vRealize Orchestrator.

By providing a plugin for vRealize Ochestrator, Nuage Networks also provides an integration framework for solutions like vCloud Director and vRealize Automation.
